Autonomous Driving System | September 2023

Project Overview
In September 2023, I spearheaded the development of an innovative AI-driven autonomous driving system, utilizing Prolog as the core technology. This project is a testament to my skills in logic programming and problem-solving, designed to navigate the complexities of real-world driving scenarios.

Key Features and Technologies

Prolog-Based AI Logic: At the heart of this system lies Prolog, a programming language renowned for its strengths in logic and rule-based programming. This choice reflects a deep understanding of logic programming paradigms and their application in artificial intelligence.

Knowledge Base Development: A comprehensive knowledge base was meticulously constructed, covering all aspects of direction control and traffic logic. This knowledge base is the foundation of the system, enabling it to make informed decisions in various driving conditions.

Rule-Based System Design: The system emphasizes a rule-based approach, ensuring that each decision made by the AI is rooted in a solid understanding of traffic rules and driving strategies.

Real-World Scenario Simulation: Complex predicates and rules were engineered to simulate a wide range of driving scenarios. This feature demonstrates not just technical expertise but also a commitment to creating a realistic and practical autonomous driving experience.

Compliance with Canadian Regulations: A significant aspect of the project was ensuring compliance with Canadian driving regulations. This adherence underscores the system's reliability and readiness for real-world application in the Canadian context.

Project Significance
This autonomous driving system stands as a significant contribution to the field of AI and autonomous vehicles. It showcases an advanced use of Prolog in creating a responsive and intelligent driving assistant, capable of making real-time decisions in complex scenarios. This project highlights my ability to integrate technical proficiency in AI and logic programming with practical applications, meeting stringent regulatory standards.
